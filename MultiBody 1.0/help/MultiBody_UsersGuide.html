<h3><font color="#008000" size=5>Upgrade from Former Versions</font></h3>

<p>
If different versions of the MultiBody library are not
compatible to each other, corresponding conversion scripts are
provided. As a result, models build with an older version
of the MultiBody library are automatically converted to the
new version when the model is loaded. The user is prompted
whether automatic conversion shall take place or not.
Problems are not to be expected. Still one should first make
a copy of such a model as backup before the conversion
is performed.
</p>

<p>
<b><font color="#008000">Upgrade from ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody</font></b>
</p>

<p>
There is now also a conversion script from the "old"
<b>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody</b> library to the
"new" MultiBody library. This script is not automatically
invoked. Since the differences between the "old" and the
"new" MultiBody library are so large, not everything is
converted and it might be that some pieces have to
be adapted manually. Still, this script is useful, since
many class names, parameters and modifiers are
automatically converted. Invoke this script in the following way:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Make a backup copy of the model that you want to convert.</li>
<li> Start a fresh Dymola. </li>
<li> Change to "Simulation" window and click on
     "Simulation / Run Script"</li>
<li> Select "<b>MultiBody/Scripts/ConvertOldToNewMultiBody.mos</b>"</li>
<li> Change to "Modeling" window and open the desired model.
     When opening the model, it is automatically converted.</li>
<li> Select the model in the "Packages" browser and click on
     "File / Save" to save the converted model under the
     same name.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Currently, components from the following sublibraries
are automatically converted
to the "new" MultiBody library:
</p>

<ul>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Parts</li>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Joints</li>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Forces</li>
<li> Part of ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>
Models using the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody library
that are programmed with <b>equations</b> are only partly converted:
The Frame connectors will be converted to the "new"
Frame connectors of the MultiBody library, but the equations
that reference variables of the Frame connectors will
<b>not</b> be converted. For a manual conversion, the following
table might be helpful showing how the <b>variables</b> of the
"old" and the "new" <b>Frame connectors</b> are
related to each other (resolve2 and angularVelocity2 are
functions from library MultiBody.Frames):
</p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>

<h3><font color="#008000" size=5>Release notes</font></h3>

<h3><font color="#008000">Version 1.0, 2004-03-03</font></h3>
<p>
This version is <b>not</b> backward compatible to version 0.99.
Models generated with previous MultiBody versions are automatically
converted to the new release.The incompatible changes are due
to improving the efficiency of the library. This required
to change function interfaces in MultiBody.Frames: angularVelocity1,
angularVelocity2, planarRotation, axisRotation, axesRotations, from_T,
from_T_inv, from_Q. Furthermore, MultiBody.Frames.Orientation has changed.
As a consequence, all code that accesses objects of this type
directly is no longer valid. Otherwise, the following changes have been made:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Faster code</b>:<br>
     Due to a different strategy to handle orientation objects,
     the number of arithmetic expressions in the generated code is
     reduced (for larger models there is a speed-up of about 2-3).</li>

<li> Improved <b>documentation</b>:<br>
     Tutorial renamed to "User's Guide" and documents restructured
     and improved. Included 3-dimensional images for nearly every
     component description where it makes sense. Improved the
     documentation of the packages.</li>

<li> New package MultiBody.Frames.<b>TransformationMatrices</b>:<br>
     This is a copy of the previous MultiBody.Frames.XX functions.
     The new MultiBody.Frames.XX functions have a different orientation
     object that can no longer be directly used, since the angular
     velocity calculation is implicitly included in the functions
     to improve efficiency significantly</li>

<li> New function MultiBody.Frames.<b>resolveRelative</b>:<br>
     Transform vector from frame 1 to frame 2 using absolute
     orientation objects of frame 1 and of frame 2.</li>

<li> Improved handling of orientation in MultiBody.Joints.<b>Spherical</b>,
     MultiBody.Joints.<b>FreeMotion</b>, MultiBody.Parts.<b>Body</b>:<br>
     If states are used from these components, the orientation is either
     described by quaternions or by 3 angles along desired sequence
     axes. If 3 angles are used, the code is such that symbolic
     transformation methods for inline integration can generate efficient
     code. In "Spherical" and "Body" the switching between different
     sets of 3 angles has been removed since this may lead to difficulties
     for the symbolic transformations. In "FreeMotion" the option to
     use quaternions has been added.</li>

<li> New option for "MultiBody.Sensors.<b>AbsoluteSensor</b>":<br>
     Optionally, the angles to rotate the world frame into frame_a
     are returned.</li>

<li> New option for "MultiBody.Sensors.<b>RelativeSensor</b>":<br>
     Optionally, the angles to rotate frame_a into frame_b
     are returned.</li>

<li> Improved "MultiBody.Examples.Loops.<b>EngineV6_analytic</b>":<br>
     Model restructured and animated with CAD data.</li>

<li> <b>Specular coefficient</b> introduced with default 0.7:<br>
     The components in Visualizers.Advanced have as additional
     input the specular coefficient describing the reflection
     of ambient light. The default is 0.7. Coordinate systems
     have a specular coefficient of 0 (= light is not reflected).
     </li>

<li> Improved MultiBody.Frames.<b>Frame_resolve</b>:<br>
     The frame outline is with a full line. When drawing a
     connection line from Frame_resolve to another frame,
     this connection line is dotted.</li>
</ul>


<h3><font color="#008000">Version 0.99, 2004-02-16</font></h3>
<p>
This version is <b>fully</b> backward compatible to version 0.98.
The following changes have been made:
</p>

<ul>
<li> New options for "MultiBody.Joints.<b>Spherical</b>".<br>
     This joint may have optionally Cardan angles or quaternions
     as states. Additionally, an "Initialization" tab has been
     added in order that the relative coordinates of the joint
     can be used for initialization.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Joints.<b>GearConstraint</b>"<br>
     to model the 3D constraint of a gear box.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Parts.<b>Mounting1D</b>" <br>
     to propagate 1D support torques to a 3D mounting.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Parts.<b>Rotor1D</b>" <br>
     to attach a 1D inertia on 3D mountings without
     neglecting dynamic effects.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Parts.<b>BevelGear1D</b>" <br>
     that describes a 1D gearbox with arbitrary shaft
     directions and that is attached on a 3D mounting.</li>
<li> New package "MultiBody.Examples.Systems.<b>RobotR3</b>".<br>
     The models of this package are used to demonstrate in which
     way complex robot models might be built up by testing first
     the component models individually before composing them together.
     Furthermore, it is shown how CAD data can be used for animation.
<li> New model "MultiBody.Sensors.<b>AbsoluteSensor</b>"<br>
     to provide kinematic quantities of a frame as output signals
     resolved in the local frame, in the world frame or in a frame that
     is connected to the AbsoluteSensor object via connector frame_resolve.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.<b>Sensors.Distance</b>"<br>
     to provide the distance between frame_a and frame_b as output signal.
     Derivatives of the distance can be easily obtained by connecting
     block Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der to the outPort.</li>
<li> New models "MultiBody.<b>Sensors.Force/.Torque/.ForceAndTorque</b>"<br>
     to provide cut forces and cut torques between two frames
     as output signals resolved in the local frame, in the world frame
     or in a frame that is connected to the objects
     via connector frame_resolve.</li>
<li> Improved model "MultiBody.<b>Sensors.RelativeSensor</b>"<br>
     A "frame_resolve" connector has been added, in order that the
     measured kinematic quantities can be resolved in the frame
     that is connected to frame_resolve.</li>
<li> New connector "MultiBody.Interfaces.<b>Frame_resolve</b>"<br>
     that should be used, if a frame provides solely orientation
     information.
     This connector is identical to the connectors "Frame", Frame_a" and
     "Frame_b". Only the icon is different: The border line is dotted
     with default line width and not with double default line width as
     for the other frames. When drawing a connection, the connection
     line is usually by default using the line style of the connector.
     As a result, the connection line will be a thin, dotted line.
     Frame_resolve is now used in all components where the orientation
     of another frame is needed (e.g., in MultiBody.Forces.Force to
     define in which frame the force is provided).</li>
<li> New function "MultiBody.Frames.<b>AngularVelocity1</b>"<br>
     to compute the angular velocity of frame 2 with respect to frame 1
     resolved in frame 1 (previously, only function AngularVelocity2
     was provided to resolve the angular velocity in frame 2. Transforming
     this vector in to frame 1 is less efficient as directly computing
     the angular velocity resolved in frame 1).</li>
<li> New conversion script "MultiBody\Scripts\<b>ConvertOldToNewMultiBody.mos</b>"<br>
     to convert models from the "old" ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody
     library to the "new" MultiBody" library. For details, see
     <A HREF="MultiBody_UsersGuide.html#MultiBody.UsersGuide.Upgrade"
>
      MultiBody.UsersGuide.Upgrade</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><font color="#008000">Version 0.98, 2003-10-27</font></h3>
<p>
This version is <b>not backward</b> compatible to the previous
MultiBody versions, since the initialization has changed.
Parameter "startValuesFixed" is no longer present and is
replaced by parameter "initType" (see below). Models generated with
previous MultiBody versions are automatically converted to the new
release.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Tutorial</b> improved.</li>

     JointUPS and alternatively a LineForceWithTwoMasses component.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.<b>Examples.InitSpringConstant</b>"<br>
     Determine spring constant such that system is in steady
     state at given position.</li>
<li> Removed model "MultiBody.Examples.ForceWithMass"<br>
     This demo is included in the new LineForceWithTwoMasses
     example.</li>
<li> Change in "MultiBody.Parts.<b>Body</b>"<br>
     The default of parameter "useQuaternions" in the
     "Advanced" menu is changed from false to true.
     This means that by default quaternions are used as
     body states.</li>
<li> Change in all models that have potential states:<br>
     <b>New initialization</b> introduced replacing the previous
     "startValuesFixed" parameter. The new parameter "initType"
     can have the following values:
<pre>
 initType = MultiBody.Types.Init
  .Free                        : no initialization
                                 (= same as previous startValuesFixed = <b>false</b>)
  .PositionVelocity            : initialize generalized position and velocity variables
                                 (= same as previous startValuesFixed = <b>true</b>)
  .SteadyState                 : initialize in steady state
                                 (velocity and acceleration are zero)
  .Position                    : initialize only generalized position variable(s)
  .Velocity                    : initialize only generalized velocity variable(s)

                                 acceleration variables
  .PositionVelocityAcceleration: initialize generalized position, velocity
                                 and acceleration variables
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><font color="#008000">Version 0.97, 2003-09-10</font></h3>
<p>
Bug fixed in model "MultiBody.Parts.Body": There was an
error when switching
from one set of Cardan angles to another one when the actual
Cardan angles are close to their singularity.
This has been corrected.
